## Requirements

EC-comparator requires:

- Python 3.10
- BedTools 2.31.1

BedTools is an external command-line dependency used by pybedtools. It is not installed by pip, so it must be installed separately.

Or, alternatively you can install these using conda/mamba ( assumes conda/mamba is preinstalled):

```
mamba install -c conda-forge -c bioconda python=3.10 bedtools=2.31.1
```


## Getting started with pip


``` 
python -m pip install EC-comparator==0.1.3
```

## Usage

Run the following example as test:

```bash
EC-comparator -a ./examples/ecdna1/true.bed \
               -b ./examples/ecdna1/reconstructed.bed \
               -d ./examples/ecdna1/output --plot --report
```

## Installation from source

Below is how to install `EC-comparator` from source. It assumes installed:
- conda/mamba
- git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmpliconSuite/EC-comparator.git
cd EC-comparator

mamba env create -f environment.yml
conda activate eccomparator

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m pip install .
which EC-comparator
EC-comparator --version
```

### Distances explained

Here we compute the cycle distance between `s1` and `s2`.

| ID | Distance | Description |
|---|---|---|
| d1 | Hamming distance | measures differences of genomic regions presence / absence for s1 and s2 |
| d2 | Cosine distance | measures the copy-number distance between the s1 and s2 using cosine distance |
| d3 | Min-max distance | measures the copy-number distance between the s1 and s2 using jaccard distance |
| d4 | Bins distance | measures differences of genomic bins usage |
| d5 | Paths distance | measures differences of paths decomposition between s1 and s2 |
| d6 | Breakpoint distance | measures differences between the breakpoint junctions profiles between s1 and s2 |

The radial plot shows all these distances, with values between 0 (low cost, high similarity) and 1 (high cost, low similarity). The more colorful the more distant are `s1` and `s2`.

**Total cost**: final score showing how dissimilar two reconstructions are (0 - highly similar, 5 - dissimilar)
